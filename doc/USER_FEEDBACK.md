User Feedback

* Wanted to make sure users could decide the size of the scrolling grid when authoring a game 
* Would be cool if you could click on an image and have it like attached to your cursor so whenever you click a square after it will add the image to that grid
* Be able to load saved custom elements that you have created before
* Add a feature where if you click and drag it will highlight everything that you are dragging across
* Deselect all button, when you fill something it will be deselected
* When you save a level it should update what you are working
* Key bindings should be more intuitive
* make buttons hot keys (P for pause, etc.)
* Make sure that users can only create custom objects with properties that are relevant to the object type (i.e. a block wouldnt have moveable-ness)
* How do different components in the GUI interract
* More descriptions on the attributes that a custom element could have (what does jumpalot mean for a block??)
* Make it easier to understand what different attributes do
* allow for no power up
* Right click on an image to see what properties it has
* Could the same image have two different implementations
* Pause the game when the change key bindings window (or other windows) are opened by the user
* When people hover over pickable elements, show attributes of entity 
* Use dropshadow in css for hovering over buttons and stuff
